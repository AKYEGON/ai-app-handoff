# Product Context: DukaFiti

## Why This Project Exists
DukaFiti addresses the critical need for affordable, accessible business management tools for Kenyan SMEs. Traditional shop owners ("duka" owners) rely on manual record-keeping, leading to inventory discrepancies, sales tracking errors, and customer management challenges.

## Problems Solved
1. **Manual Inventory Management**: Eliminates paper-based stock tracking with real-time inventory updates
2. **Sales Tracking Inaccuracies**: Provides digital POS system with multiple payment method support
3. **Customer Relationship Gaps**: Enables customer credit management and purchase history tracking
4. **Offline Operation Needs**: Functions without internet with automatic synchronization when online
5. **M-Pesa Integration**: Seamlessly integrates Kenya's most popular mobile payment system

## How It Should Work
- **User Onboarding**: Simple sign-up with 14-day free trial
- **Shop Setup**: Quick business profile creation with location and business type
- **Inventory Management**: Barcode scanning or manual entry with stock alerts
- **Sales Processing**: Fast checkout with cash, M-Pesa, or credit options
- **Customer Management**: Track customer purchases, debts, and credit limits
- **Reporting**: Daily sales reports, profit analysis, and business insights
- **Offline Mode**: Continue operations during internet outages with data sync

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Intuitive interface for non-technical users
- **Speed**: Fast transaction processing (< 30 seconds per sale)
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with robust error handling
- **Accessibility**: Mobile-first design with Swahili language support
- **Security**: Bank-level security for financial transactions

## Target User Personas
1. **Small Shop Owner**: Needs basic inventory and sales tracking
2. **Medium Retailer**: Requires customer management and reporting
3. **Multiple Location Owner**: Needs multi-shop synchronization
4. **Offline-First User**: Operates in areas with unreliable internet
