# Active Context: DukaFiti

## Current Work Focus
Comprehensive testing and analysis of DukaFiti application to identify development and user experience issues. The app is fully functional with Supabase backend integration but requires security enhancements and performance optimizations.

## Recent Changes
- Connected to Supabase backend using MCP server
- Discovered 24 active users, 91 customers, 185 products, and 593 sales records
- Identified security vulnerabilities in Supabase configuration
- Encountered Playwright installation issues for automated testing
- Populated memory bank with project documentation

## Next Steps
### Immediate Actions (1-2 days):
1. **Security Hardening**
   - Enable leaked password protection in Supabase Auth
   - Update PostgreSQL to latest secure version
   - Move API keys to environment variables
   - Implement proper error boundaries

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Resolve Playwright installation issues
   - Set up Jest and React Testing Library
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Add loading states for data-intensive operations
   - Enhance offline synchronization

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks):
1. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
   - Add comprehensive help documentation and tooltips
   - Simplify onboarding process for non-technical users
   - Enhance mobile responsiveness

2. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Complete M-Pesa integration testing
   - Improve offline mode reliability
   - Add advanced reporting features
   - Implement multi-shop support

3. **Documentation**
   - Create user manuals and API documentation
   - Develop deployment guide
   - Add contributor guidelines
   - Create troubleshooting documentation

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Security vs. Usability**: Balancing strong security measures with user-friendly experience
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Ensuring data consistency during synchronization
- **Performance vs. Features**: Prioritizing core functionality over extensive features
- **Market Focus**: Maintaining Kenya-specific features while ensuring international compatibility

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Enforce strict type checking across all components
- **Component Modularity**: Keep components focused and reusable
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Testing Culture**: Prioritize test-driven development practices

## Learnings and Project Insights
1. **Supabase Integration**: Successful backend integration but requires security review
2. **Offline Capabilities**: Robust offline synchronization implementation
3. **User Adoption**: 24 active users indicate product-market fit
4. **Technical Debt**: Significant security and performance work needed
5. **Testing Gap**: Lack of automated testing poses maintenance risks

## Current Priorities
1. Address critical security vulnerabilities
2. Establish reliable testing infrastructure
3. Improve performance and user experience
4. Enhance documentation and onboarding
5. Prepare for production deployment

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Security vulnerabilities could compromise user data
- **Medium Risk**: Performance issues may affect user retention
- **Low Risk**: Missing features can be incrementally added

## Success Metrics Tracking
- User count: 24 active users
- Data volume: 593 sales records, 91 customers
- Performance: TBD (needs measurement)
- Error rate: TBD (needs monitoring)
- User satisfaction: TBD (needs feedback collection)
