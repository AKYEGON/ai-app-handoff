# Progress: DukaFiti

## What Works
- **Complete Authentication System**: Email and Google sign-in fully functional
- **Database Integration**: Supabase PostgreSQL with 24 active users
- **Core Business Features**: Inventory management, customer tracking, sales processing
- **Offline Capabilities**: Local storage caching with sync queue system
- **Real-time Updates**: Supabase real-time subscriptions working
- **PWA Implementation**: Service workers and offline functionality

## What's Left to Build
### High Priority
- Security hardening (password protection, API key management)
- Testing infrastructure (unit tests, integration tests)
- Performance optimization (code splitting, lazy loading)
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Medium Priority
- M-Pesa integration completion
- Advanced reporting features
- Multi-shop support
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness

### Low Priority
- Additional payment method integrations
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Multi-language support (Swahili)
- Bulk operations and imports

## Current Status
- **Backend**: Fully functional with production data
- **Frontend**: Complete but needs optimization
- **Security**: Critical vulnerabilities identified
- **Testing**: Infrastructure incomplete
- **Performance**: Requires optimization
- **Documentation**: Partially complete

## Known Issues
### Critical Issues
1. Supabase Auth leaked password protection disabled
2. Outdated PostgreSQL version with security patches
3. Hardcoded API keys in client-side code
4. Playwright testing infrastructure failing

### High Priority Issues
1. No unit or integration tests
2. Large bundle sizes affecting performance
3. Missing accessibility features
4. Console logging in production code

### Medium Priority Issues
1. External image URLs hardcoded
2. Incomplete TypeScript types in some areas
3. Missing error boundaries for some components
4. Browserslist data outdated

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Architecture**: Chose React 18 + TypeScript + Vite for modern development experience
- **Database**: Selected Supabase for real-time capabilities and PostgreSQL reliability
- **State Management**: Implemented TanStack Query for efficient server-state handling
- **Offline Strategy**: Developed custom sync system with localStorage and conflict resolution
- **UI Library**: Adopted Shadcn/ui for consistent design system

## Data Metrics
- **Users**: 24 active accounts
- **Customers**: 91 customer records
- **Products**: 185 inventory items
- **Sales**: 593 transactions recorded
- **Debt Payments**: 79 payment records

## Recent Improvements
- Connected Supabase MCP server for backend analysis
- Identified security vulnerabilities through Supabase advisors
- Populated comprehensive memory bank documentation
- Verified authentication flow functionality
- Confirmed offline synchronization capabilities

## Next Development Phase
1. **Security First**: Address all critical security vulnerabilities
2. **Testing Foundation**: Establish complete testing infrastructure
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement code splitting and bundle optimization
4. **User Experience**: Enhance accessibility and mobile responsiveness
5. **Documentation**: Complete user guides and API documentation
