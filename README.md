## ðŸ¤– AI Code Assistant

This project includes an AI-powered code assistant using DeepSeek V3.1 via Siliconflow. The AI can propose and apply code changes safely through a review workflow.

### Quick Start with AI Assistant

1. **Set up environment variables** (Replit Secrets):
   - `SILICONFLOW_API_KEY` - Your Siliconflow API key
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub token for PR creation

2. **Start both services**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use the combined startup script
   chmod +x start-ai-dev.sh
   ./start-ai-dev.sh
   
   # Option 2: Manual startup (2 terminals)
   # Terminal 1: Main app
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2: AI middleware
   cd ai && npm install && npm start
   ```

3. **Use the AI chat interface**:
   - Navigate to `/ai-chat.html` in your browser
   - Describe code changes you want
   - Review proposed changes
   - Apply selected changes (creates GitHub PR)

### AI Workflow Features

- âœ… **Safe proposeâ†’reviewâ†’apply loop**
- âœ… **Automatic PR creation** 
- âœ… **Test validation** before applying changes
- âœ… **Never auto-applies to main branch**
- âœ… **Diff visualization** for all changes
- âœ… **Model fallback** (deepseek-v3.1-instruct â†’ deepseek-coder-v2-instruct â†’ deepseek-v3.1)

See `ai/README.md` for detailed documentation.
